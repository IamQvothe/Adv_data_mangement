# Adv_data_mangement
This is my project for the class Advanced Data Management or known as D326

The project was to create a business problem and solve it using Postgresql and a premade dataset called dvdrental from postgresqls sample DBs

My business problem was to create a report that determined which users were the most frequent renters and highest grossing. I suggested that this report could be used in conjuction with the implementation of a reward system based on high revenue generating customers.
